### Technology
Built using Python and the Telebot framework, the bot is a testament to modern software simplicity and efficiency. The choice of Python ensures ease of development and maintenance, while the Telebot framework offers robustness and scalability. The underlying SQLite database ensures data persistence and security.

This bot is more than just a technological project; it's a tool designed to enrich the everyday lives of its users by helping them to notice and cherish the positive moments that often go unnoticed.


## Features
- **Record Smiles:** Users can record their happy moments along with the date.
- **View Smiles:** Users can view all their recorded smiles.
- **Update Smiles:** Users can update the details of their recorded smiles.
- **Delete Smiles:** Users can delete any of their recorded smiles.
- **Weekly Prompts:** The bot sends weekly reminders to users to record their smiles.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- SQLite3

### Setup
#### Clone the Repository:
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd [repository-directory]

#### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional):
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

#### Install Dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Set up the Telegram Bot Token:
- Create a bot in Telegram using BotFather and get the bot token.
- Set the bot token in `config.py`.

#### Initialize the Database:
- Ensure the SQLite database file path in `main.py` is correct.
- Run `main.py` to initialize the database.


## Usage

### Start the Bot:
    python main.py

### Interact with the Bot on Telegram:
- Use the command `/start` to initiate the bot.
- Follow the inline keyboard or command prompts to interact with the bot.

### Commands
- `/start`: Starts the bot and registers the user.
- `/addsmile`: Adds a new smile.
- `/mysmiles`: Displays all recorded smiles.
- `/updatesmile`: Updates a specific smile.
- `/deletesmile`: Deletes a specific smile.

## Development
- **Configurations:** Modify `settings.py` for bot token and other settings.
- **Logging:** Logs are saved in `bot.log`. Configure logging in `main.py`.


## File Structure and Design Choices
- **main.py:** This is the entry point of the bot. It initializes the database and starts the bot's polling. We chose Python for its simplicity and the rich ecosystem of libraries.
- **settings.py:** Contains configuration settings like the bot token. We separated configurations for easy management and to enhance security by not hardcoding sensitive information.
- **database.py:** Manages database interactions. We used SQLite for its lightweight nature and ease of integration with Python.
- **utils.py:** Contains handlers for different bot commands. This modular approach makes the codebase maintainable and scalable.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists all the Python dependencies required for the bot. This file simplifies the setup process by allowing all dependencies to be installed with a single command. It ensures consistency across different environments, making the bot more reliable and easier to deploy.


## Why SQLite and Telebot?
I chose SQLite due to its simplicity, requiring no separate server, and its efficiency for small-scale applications.
Telebot framework was selected for its straightforward syntax and extensive documentation, facilitating rapid development of Telegram bots.


## Future Enhancements
- **User Authentication:** To enhance security and provide a more personalized experience. Implementing user authentication will ensure that each user's data is secure and accessible only to them.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** To enable more intuitive user interactions. Incorporating NLP could make the bot understand and respond to user inputs in a more human-like manner, improving overall user experience.
- **Data Backup and Export:** Offering users the ability to backup or export their smiles. This feature would allow users to keep a secure copy of their data and easily transfer it if they switch devices or want to view it outside the bot.


## Conclusion
The Smile Summary bot is more than just a project; it's a tool for fostering positivity. 
Each line of code was written with the intention of bringing smiles to users' faces, reminding them of the good in their daily lives.
